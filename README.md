# IoT-Phantom-Delay-Attack
Supplementary Materials of DSN 2022 paper "IoT Phantom-Delay Attacks: Demystifying and Exploiting IoT Timeout Behaviors"

This repository contains the sample code and details to replicate the delay attack as described in 
> IoT Phantom-Delay Attacks: Demystifying and Exploiting IoT Timeout Behaviors (IEEE/IETF DSN 2022)

We include the attack artifacts for different devices in different folders. We use the Ring and Homekit as two representitive examples for the cloud-based and local-based IoT servers, respectively.
